# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ShuttleStandaloneDBCreator is a Java-based application for creating standalone database instances. This project is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Development Setup

This project appears to be a new Java project that will likely use Maven or Gradle for build management. As the project structure develops, this section will be updated with specific build commands.

Expected development commands (to be confirmed once build files are added):
- Build: `mvn clean compile` or `gradle build`
- Test: `mvn test` or `gradle test`
- Package: `mvn package` or `gradle jar`

## Architecture

The project structure and architecture will be documented here as the codebase develops. Based on the name, this project will likely include:
- Database schema creation utilities
- Standalone database instance management
- Configuration and deployment scripts

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a new/empty project - verify build tool choice (Maven vs Gradle) when creating initial structure
- Project appears to be Java-based - follow standard Java naming conventions and package structure
- Database-related functionality should follow JDBC best practices when implemented
